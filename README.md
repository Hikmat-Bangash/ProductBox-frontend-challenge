# Project Stack
This project was developed using a variety of technologies to achieve its goals. Each technology was carefully selected to meet specific requirements and improve the overall development process. Here's a brief overview of the stack used in this project:

## 1. TypeScript
TypeScript was chosen as the primary programming language for this project due to its strong typing system. By using TypeScript, we can catch potential errors during development, resulting in more reliable and maintainable code. This helps to prevent common runtime issues and improves the overall quality of the project.

## 2. Next.js for Frontend
Next.js was employed for building the front end of the application. It offers several advantages, including server-side rendering, routing, and a strong development ecosystem. These features enhance the performance and user experience of the application, making it a suitable choice for modern web development.

## 3. Tailwind CSS for Styling
Tailwind CSS was utilized to streamline the styling process. It's a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid development and consistent styling across the application. With its utility classes, we can efficiently create responsive and visually appealing user interfaces without writing extensive custom CSS.

## 4. React Hook Form with Yup for Validation
React Hook Form, in combination with the Yup validation library, was chosen to handle form validation. This approach provides a simple and efficient way to manage form state and validation logic. Yup's schema-based validation ensures data integrity and improves the user experience by preventing invalid input.

## 5. Redux Toolkit for State Management
The Redux-Toolkit was employed for state management within the application. It simplifies the setup and configuration of Redux, reducing boilerplate code. By using the Redux Toolkit, we can efficiently manage and share the application state, making it easier to maintain and scale the project.
